sam, every time I went to your house you would start watching either youtube or movies. so I'm guessing that's how you spend your free time. the youtube videos were also usually about games so I assume that maybe when I wasn't over you also played games.

so you constantly post these questions. why, why is it so hard for you to understand that we aren't living the same life ?

sam , when did I ever say I liked games ? I don't at all. so how is it that you think I would rather have an arcade than be married ? that is the most insane guess in the whole world. you made a random guess, that somebody who never talked about arcades or game rooms or enjoying games even a single time, would probably rather have a game room than a wife 

also, I never want kids under any circumstances. I have never said anything other than that. despite that I have literally not a single time seen you make a "guess" about what I want my future to be like other than one with kids.

so you are gonna look hayley dead in the eye and tell them "these are my best guesses. this is what I think people are like. the most enthusiastic gamers never talk about gaming."

sam you are back to suggesting that a man would transition to become a woman because you apparently believe being dependent on a man is a good thing that is desirable and people pretend to be women in order to achieve that. why do you think people want that?

you are such a fucking terf it's so nightmarish holy shit

edit: also did you just start trying to highlight the fact I'm unemployed, directly after I made a commit to the project im working on in my free time ? do the things I spend my time on make you feel insecure about how you spend your time (hand creating spam on reddit) ? sam there are so many things I feel like you show jealousy about, and you spend a thousand times as much energy on your jealousy of those things as I ever had to spend to accomplish them. getting good at songwriting is actually an extremely believable thing. you just don't believe in yourself. and when you see these things you think to yourself that you could never do the same. which is not even true, you spend more energy trying to invalidate my good qualities than it would take for you to have those qualities

what is wrong with you, you are not a fucking idiot, you know a pedophile would not take you to the place they are trying to groom children. so this is just, you, wanting to ask a bunch of young teen boys if cute or hot is better

Sam are you actually a pedophile ? this shit has gotten so fucking weird, and you won't let it go, it's like you wanted an excuse to be disgusting towards young boys. there is no fucking excuse

sam you are such a gaslighter.you tried to convince hayley that morrigan was a young boy. they are less than a month younger than me. what is wrong with you. who the fuck makes up false accusations of pedophilia. if you were going to do that you could have at least tried, morrigan is a person you can find them in an online phone book I'll put their last name in the drive in a second. again this is what makes me say you are just straight up dumb. who , literally who comes up with such a shitty impulsive lie like that. and the fact you are creeping out real life young boys knowingly for zero reason whatsoever is fucking disgusting

sam what is happening. the concept of being attracted to parenthood is inherently disgusting and that's the only reason I can possibly understand why you constantly write about it. can I make something very clear, my sister is a professional babysitter and she works full time, my mom is a literal registered nurse who works with premature infants on the verge of death which I really don't think is even close to the picture you paint when you talk about these types of things, the connection you made to my mom and sister's gender is purely your own sexism. I don't know what on earth that would even have to do with being attracted to parenthood? sam that is disgusting. again you are like freud if you took out everything valuable and left just the disgustingness and sexism.

can we go back several months rn. bc I feel like you made a really sexist assumption. you once wrote to me from an account talking about how an ai told you that "men tend to think more rationally, where as women tend to be more nurturing" and holy shit I could not have wanted to vomit faster. later I remembered something I had said a few days ago and it made me really sad that the person who I thought was doing all this at the time, hayley, would have made this awful assumption. you were writing some transphobic garbage that was obviously implying that if you were "raised male" you are fundamentally different from cis girls and you are invalid. that shit is beyond transphobic. I quoted a study that found on brain imaging scans that certain physical characteristics of your brain are differentiated by gender but that they found trans people's brains had more similar brains to the cis people of the gender they are, than to the brains of people of their assigned gender at birth. one of the main differences that they used to tell apart between the genders are the complexity and number of connections between the two hemispheres of your brain

you could've looked it up. you are too sexist, and you assumed that I thought something in reality, you clearly think. otherwise you would have maybe considered the possibility women have more connections between their brain hemispheres than men. which is the case....you did not even care to look it up which suggests you thought you already knew the answer...why did you think it was impossible that women might have more than men ?

what?

sam you have to be making a joke

it's an app. it's not oxygen?

I spent the entire summer of 2019 in hospitals and residential. they don't let you have phones, or even books that are interesting because they can't reference anything remotely rated r. but yes I can't live without reddit /s

actually this is not a joke this is another projection (this time I'm being kind of silly though) sam you can't live without reddit. it is like oxygen to you because it's the one thing keeping hayley from confirming for a fact that you are the horrible person they have suspicions you are.

have you noticed that the only reason I use reddit anymore is to point out how ass your content is ? I do miss how reddit was before you started posting all the time ...I actually like reddit a lot because of the separations by subreddit. I feel like you constantly write weird things like "im reddit virgin #2747363 haha 😎" and it's like,,,I never saw anyone make such a joke about the fact they use reddit until you started making catfishes that did. I feel like you tend to take very insignificant traits about me, and then make up a characterization of said trait that does not even exist , and write people self identifying said connection that does not even exist.

this app has r/ihavesex but the content you make would be r/idonthavesex. holy fuck we get the point sam. the funniest part about all of this was that your personality used to be r/idonthavesex, and you didn't have sex until you were older than both me and hayley... and I only point that out to say me and hayley weren't mocking you for saying that kind of crap because nobody cares other than you,which is clear by the things you write

I don't understand how you keep a straight face while claiming I have a secret reddit account. and I am seriously thinking I should be spending *my* energy looking for your secret tumblr account which I actually know exists. can I ask you a question Sam

Sam you stigmatize mental health problems a shocking amount. you also don't understand them. having mental health problems mean you very much notice the difference between the way you struggle and the way the rest of the world does. since when was everyone secretly mentally ill

Sam I think this is just you projecting your denial of your obvious mental health problems as suggesting that people with mental health problems just don't understand that everyone is struggling that way and they just deal with it. no sam, you are dealing with something that the vast majority of people don't struggle with, and you need help with it

uhhhhhhh okay I have so many things to say right now

1. It's so funny to me that every time I point out how you cannot keep a story straight to save your life, you start committing even further to you being obviously intensely wrong.the more wrong you feel, the more embarrassed you get and the more you try to shove your obviously dumbass ideas down our throats 

2. was the stairs thing a suggestion of ocd ? you are a shitty person for thinking ocd is a dislikable trait that would make hayley not want to be with me. I say that in defense of people w ocd I don't have it you have read clinical evaluations of me Sam

3. there's only one other guess I have which is you're mentioning exposure therapy because I did not do exposure therapy for my eating disorder like my dietitian wanted for me. okay, sam, so when my last therapy did tried emdr with me and it made me want to kill myself, should I have just kept doing it because "the only way to face your trauma is head on" and because "it's the standard care for PTSD"? I am twenty years old holy shit give me a break last year I recovered from multiple drug addictions one of which lead me into fucking psychosis. the year before that I had been attempting suicide. I would say I did a lot of fucking work on myself.

I have so much goddamn food trauma sam you have no idea and half of it is about that not just exposure. the amount of mental energy and time I spend working on my trauma, is more than you could ever fucking imagine, sam, this is laughable. you were telling me you wanted to kill yourself before *even I* started telling people I wanted to kill myself. you are just in denial about all of your problems and choose to not work on a damn thing about yourself, while trying to tell me I'm not working hard enough? you are the kind of person who gave up on seeing their character flaws as real flaws because you didn't feel like working on it and being a good person was worth the effort.

you are a really shitty person

sam rhyming isn't joking? again I called hayley unprecedentedly pretty and it made your ears bleed. Sam you are so predictable. I think I'm really starting to understand you. it's all like paul thing. "oh god shut up shut up shut up." everything you say as gaslighting to Hayley, the difference between what actually happened and what you came up with, is so funny and embarrassing as to why you felt the need to do all of this. you hate the story of how I met Hayley just as much as you hate how pretty they are. when I called hayley unprecedentedly pretty you could not bear it.

now here's all this stuff I never said. sam, it is painful the way you reply to these and call yourself clever. the most embarrassing part is that you actually spent time coming up with this. when did I rhyme two things and pass it off as a joke? also, again have you lived in the real world ? a joke like that is something you would hear in like an instructional video or something and would not cause anyone on earth to do more than politely chuckle...

you know I actually was instilled a sense of "be strong, be independent, don't ask for help from anybody do everything yourself," by my mom. my mom constantly tried highlight the value of independence. she mostly did so as an excuse to neglect us

I was taught to never ask for help as a kid. but not by my dad, he was constantly begging us to ask for things because my mom had us trained the opposite way.

so maybe you picked up on that. then, sam-vision took hold and you said "I know this stereotype, Reina most have a dad with insecure masculinity, and she must think she is being manly by not wanting to ask for help. this is clearly insecure masculinity" she says about the traits I picked up from my mom

I think the only reason you ever suggested anything regarding "insecure masculinity " was as a weird excuse to assume I am hiding a secretive personality...
