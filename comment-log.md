you really , *really* should've just stopped responding or something. the things I wrote clearly stressed you out and you felt a need to keep writing weird fucking shit. but holy fuck,nobody acts like this,,, literally anywhere on the whole app.

sam can you find Hayley an example of an interaction like this one occurring anywhere else on the entirety of reddit ?

i am asking the question because the answer is no

goodnight hayley I love you

this is suspicious, it's really suspicious that I'm commenting after I said goodnight to Hayley don't you think ? don't go to sleep for hours, if I stop making comments it's probably just a cover, I'm probably still awake and just waiting for you to go to sleep so I can start asking the teen boys my own questions. you need to be suspicious. do not ever go to sleep sam

sam I'm just gonna pretend were having a conversation 

okay, gross, I don't know why you think anyone should do that that's disgusting. what I said was you *wouldn't* suggest that, which is a fact, because you are transphobic

hayley is not transphobic, so you must have told lies to them, and told them I made up details about my transition.

you are screwed come monday morning. I could not be happier about it. you tried to trap hayley now no one's ever gonna wanna be your friend again bc everyone's gonna know how horrible of a person you are.you should really go to sleep, stop posting on reddit and enjoy some quality time with your friends while they still like you

and hayley im writing this despite that hopefully nothing I wrote will ever end up mattering whatsoever but it's also relevant just to say that all of the trauma you have had from people who were drunk, were already capable of those things in a way most people are not and ik that because there is no intoxication on anything that would cause me to be abusive

stop future faking, you know just as well as I do that my hobbies are real. you are a gaslighter, you were on my ig and you saw me play weak when ur around, me and ur ghost and other songs on my guitar. you saw me play original songs I wrote when I was 15 on my ukulele. and then told hayley I must have tricked them (tricked them??? again sam you are stupid, these things, are impossible) into thinking I played the guitar. you couldn't even bare to admit that you knew I had a quality as simple as playing the guitar

you are such a fucking terf it's so nightmarish holy shit

edit: also did you just start trying to highlight the fact I'm unemployed, directly after I made a commit to the project im working on in my free time ? do the things I spend my time on make you feel insecure about how you spend your time (hand creating spam on reddit) ? sam there are so many things I feel like you show jealousy about, and you spend a thousand times as much energy on your jealousy of those things as I ever had to spend to accomplish them. getting good at songwriting is actually an extremely believable thing. you just don't believe in yourself. and when you see these things you think to yourself that you could never do the same. which is not even true, you spend more energy trying to invalidate my good qualities than it would take for you to have those qualities

what is wrong with you, you are not a fucking idiot, you know a pedophile would not take you to the place they are trying to groom children. so this is just, you, wanting to ask a bunch of young teen boys if cute or hot is better

Sam are you actually a pedophile ? this shit has gotten so fucking weird, and you won't let it go, it's like you wanted an excuse to be disgusting towards young boys. there is no fucking excuse

sam you are such a gaslighter.you tried to convince hayley that morrigan was a young boy. they are less than a month younger than me. what is wrong with you. who the fuck makes up false accusations of pedophilia. if you were going to do that you could have at least tried, morrigan is a person you can find them in an online phone book I'll put their last name in the drive in a second. again this is what makes me say you are just straight up dumb. who , literally who comes up with such a shitty impulsive lie like that. and the fact you are creeping out real life young boys knowingly for zero reason whatsoever is fucking disgusting

sam what is happening. the concept of being attracted to parenthood is inherently disgusting and that's the only reason I can possibly understand why you constantly write about it. can I make something very clear, my sister is a professional babysitter and she works full time, my mom is a literal registered nurse who works with premature infants on the verge of death which I really don't think is even close to the picture you paint when you talk about these types of things, the connection you made to my mom and sister's gender is purely your own sexism. I don't know what on earth that would even have to do with being attracted to parenthood? sam that is disgusting. again you are like freud if you took out everything valuable and left just the disgustingness and sexism.

can we go back several months rn. bc I feel like you made a really sexist assumption. you once wrote to me from an account talking about how an ai told you that "men tend to think more rationally, where as women tend to be more nurturing" and holy shit I could not have wanted to vomit faster. later I remembered something I had said a few days ago and it made me really sad that the person who I thought was doing all this at the time, hayley, would have made this awful assumption. you were writing some transphobic garbage that was obviously implying that if you were "raised male" you are fundamentally different from cis girls and you are invalid. that shit is beyond transphobic. I quoted a study that found on brain imaging scans that certain physical characteristics of your brain are differentiated by gender but that they found trans people's brains had more similar brains to the cis people of the gender they are, than to the brains of people of their assigned gender at birth. one of the main differences that they used to tell apart between the genders are the complexity and number of connections between the two hemispheres of your brain

you could've looked it up. you are too sexist, and you assumed that I thought something in reality, you clearly think. otherwise you would have maybe considered the possibility women have more connections between their brain hemispheres than men. which is the case....you did not even care to look it up which suggests you thought you already knew the answer...why did you think it was impossible that women might have more than men ?

sam you have to be making a joke

it's an app. it's not oxygen?

I spent the entire summer of 2019 in hospitals and residential. they don't let you have phones, or even books that are interesting because they can't reference anything remotely rated r. but yes I can't live without reddit /s

actually this is not a joke this is another projection (this time I'm being kind of silly though) sam you can't live without reddit. it is like oxygen to you because it's the one thing keeping hayley from confirming for a fact that you are the horrible person they have suspicions you are.

have you noticed that the only reason I use reddit anymore is to point out how ass your content is ? I do miss how reddit was before you started posting all the time ...I actually like reddit a lot because of the separations by subreddit. I feel like you constantly write weird things like "im reddit virgin #2747363 haha 😎" and it's like,,,I never saw anyone make such a joke about the fact they use reddit until you started making catfishes that did. I feel like you tend to take very insignificant traits about me, and then make up a characterization of said trait that does not even exist , and write people self identifying said connection that does not even exist.

this app has r/ihavesex but the content you make would be r/idonthavesex. holy fuck we get the point sam. the funniest part about all of this was that your personality used to be r/idonthavesex, and you didn't have sex until you were older than both me and hayley... and I only point that out to say me and hayley weren't mocking you for saying that kind of crap because nobody cares other than you,which is clear by the things you write

I don't understand how you keep a straight face while claiming I have a secret reddit account. and I am seriously thinking I should be spending *my* energy looking for your secret tumblr account which I actually know exists. can I ask you a question Sam

could you even live without Tumblr?

false

Sam you stigmatize mental health problems a shocking amount. you also don't understand them. having mental health problems mean you very much notice the difference between the way you struggle and the way the rest of the world does. since when was everyone secretly mentally ill

Sam I think this is just you projecting your denial of your obvious mental health problems as suggesting that people with mental health problems just don't understand that everyone is struggling that way and they just deal with it. no sam, you are dealing with something that the vast majority of people don't struggle with, and you need help with it

Sam this thread feels like it's designed to trap your own self into saying something unlikable

I hate all religious people 

the chances of heaven existing are none

this is not hard to understand sam

edit: ew fucking gross. I just saw another thread where you wrote that "republicans being the party of jesus" is "the biggest lie ever told" that makes me want to vomit sam. you are SUCH a gaslighter it's unbelievable. you cannot possibly keep a single story straight to save your damn life. "she's a trump supporter." *proves you knew that was a lie* "oh I guess I'm insane and I had dementia, but but, I totally, she totally talks about jesus that definitely happened, she just is one of the ones that says republicans aren't really christian" you are so fucking ridiculous, you are a literal clown

edit 2: oh sorry, I see , is all of this happening because I reminded you how I think your best friend is so so much prettier than you are?

holy shit that is so unfunny

sam rhyming isn't joking? again I called hayley unprecedentedly pretty and it made your ears bleed. Sam you are so predictable. I think I'm really starting to understand you. it's all like paul thing. "oh god shut up shut up shut up." everything you say as gaslighting to Hayley, the difference between what actually happened and what you came up with, is so funny and embarrassing as to why you felt the need to do all of this. you hate the story of how I met Hayley just as much as you hate how pretty they are. when I called hayley unprecedentedly pretty you could not bear it.

now here's all this stuff I never said. sam, it is painful the way you reply to these and call yourself clever. the most embarrassing part is that you actually spent time coming up with this. when did I rhyme two things and pass it off as a joke? also, again have you lived in the real world ? a joke like that is something you would hear in like an instructional video or something and would not cause anyone on earth to do more than politely chuckle...

Sam making something rhyme doesn't mean what you said was interesting....

oh wow so this has been going on all day LMAO

okay Sam. you are so ridiculous. you have seen me cry plenty of times everyone in our friend group have. sometimes you make accounts from agoraphobic people who spend their whole day locked in their room doing nothing other than crying, other times it's this, you cannot possibly keep your stories straight

also sam wtf. "I don't know if...as a man....I'll ever be able walk on this planet again" have you ever spoken to a real person? it's wild how much of an alien you sound like on here

you know I actually was instilled a sense of "be strong, be independent, don't ask for help from anybody do everything yourself," by my mom. my mom constantly tried highlight the value of independence. she mostly did so as an excuse to neglect us

I was taught to never ask for help as a kid. but not by my dad, he was constantly begging us to ask for things because my mom had us trained the opposite way.

so maybe you picked up on that. then, sam-vision took hold and you said "I know this stereotype, Reina most have a dad with insecure masculinity, and she must think she is being manly by not wanting to ask for help. this is clearly insecure masculinity" she says about the traits I picked up from my mom

I think the only reason you ever suggested anything regarding "insecure masculinity " was as a weird excuse to assume I am hiding a secretive personality...

sam you constantly posts suggestions of songs, movies, etc. that you think I would have specific sentiments towards. you have literally never once guessed a song or movie that I care about. you have made thousands, literally thousands of these guesses, and zero of them have been accurate. that is because my Spotify playlists are public, me and you like the same movies, and I don't think you understands tjst people have been making music, songs, art, history has been occuring, things have been being discovered, for literally fucking centuries. centuries Sam. everything you guess about, are things that have centuries worth of content to make random guesses on

sam you are such a gaslighter it's unbelievable. I sent Hayley this and you said "uhhjhhhhhhhhh maybe she  doesn't care anymore?" you truly want anything other than for hayley to be happy

sam you are definitely the only one who does that ...why do you think writing freakishly specific things makes sense. it's disturbing it feels like you really don't understand how the real world works. what you're doing is like trying to guess random facts about the lives of strangers you are pointing at on the street. and I mean that extremely literally as what on earth could I have said that would be a hint towards this being a habit of mine ? I only keep bringing this up because I feel like it needs citations. these are the kinds of things that lead me me to say you "are actually stupid"
